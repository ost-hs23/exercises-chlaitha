-   Making graphs and writing research note

## A task I find challenging

-   Data managment and anlaysis

## One with a fact I want to learn

-   I find difficult to organise data and ouputs

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
